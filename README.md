# Simple-Banking-Application
In this implementation:

    The main method contains a loop that continuously prompts the user to choose an action.
    The user can choose to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit the application.
    For deposit and withdrawal, the user is prompted to enter an amount.
    The switch statement handles the user's choice and calls the appropriate method.
    The loop continues until the user chooses to exit (option 4), at which point the scanner is closed and the program terminates.

This implementation provides a basic console-based user interface for the SimpleBank class. You can further enhance this by adding error handling (e.g., for invalid input types) and additional features as needed.
